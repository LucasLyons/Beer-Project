Since basic collaborative filtering frameworks only account for a single user-item interaction, we need to specify an approach for dealing with these cases. In our simple model, we'll take the most recent rating as the \"true\" value. Later we'll experiment with different approaches."

First of all, we saw from the EDA that many beers and users only have one review - this is the cold start problem. Also, since we'll be using a training, validation, and testing set, we need a threshold of at least 3. We'll investigate how different thresholds affect the tradeoff between coverage of recommended items and the quality of recommendations."
